This setup only works if the category is a string, it wont work with integers.

Workarounds:
  If all your posts live in their own category directory, and you don't declare
  a category in yaml front matter, just make sure your index's parent variable
  is encased in quotes.

  If your posts all live in /_posts/ and have an explicit category (or array
  of categories) make sure the category name in yaml front matter is encased in
  quotes as well.
